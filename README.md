# PY-CL-Input_Output

## Overview

This project focuses on handling user input and output operations in Python. It includes functions to interactively collect user input as strings, integers, and floats. Additionally, it demonstrates how to mock user input for testing purposes. The project consists of three main files: `app.py`, `lab.py`, and `lab_test.py`.

## Files

### app.py
The `app.py` file serves as the main script for the project. It allows users to input their name as a string, age as an integer, and height as a float. The inputs are validated to ensure they are of the correct data type, and appropriate error messages are displayed if invalid input is provided.

### lab.py
The `lab.py` file contains the implementation of functions for collecting user input. It includes functions to collect input as strings, integers, and floats, with validation to handle incorrect input types.

### lab_test.py
The `lab_test.py` file contains unit tests for the functions defined in `lab.py`. It uses mocking to simulate user input and verifies that the functions correctly handle different input scenarios.

## Project Structure

- src/
  - main/
    - app.py
    - lab.py
  - test/
    - lab_test.py

## Getting Started

- Open the `app.py` file in the `src/main` directory.
- Run the `app.py` file to interactively collect user input.
- Follow the prompts to input your name, age, and height, ensuring you provide inputs of the correct data types.
- Review the implementation of functions in `lab.py` to understand how user input is collected and validated.

## Testing

- Open the `lab_test.py` file in the `src/test directory`.
- Run the `lab_test.py` file to execute the unit tests.
- Ensure that all tests pass, indicating that the implemented functions handle user input correctly.

## Conclusion

This project provides practical examples of handling user input and output in Python. By exploring the functions in `lab.py` and running the tests in `lab_test.py`, users can learn how to collect and validate user input effectively, improving their Python programming skills.


Happy Coding!
